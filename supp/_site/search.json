    "text": "Primary findings\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation of Mounds Plantation and Gahagan Mound, illustrating local geology, and geographic extent of ancestral Caddo area (dashed white).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGahagan bifaces from Caddo burial contexts at Gahagan Mound and Mounds Plantation.\n\n\n\n\n\nColor\nGahagan bifaces were scanned at 600 dpi using an HP ScanJet G4050. Images were subsequently transferred to a transparent background in Photoshop in preparation for analysis using the colordistance package in R (R Core Development Team, 2022; Weller and Westneat 2019). A histogram binning method was used to group similar colors, and pairwise distances between histograms were computed using earth mover’s distance, yielding two distinct raw material color groups (Rubner and Tomasi 2001; Weller and Westneat 2019).\n\n\n\n\n\nGahagan bifaces from Gahagan Mound and Mounds Plantation were used to identify color groups. In this graph, dark pink corresponds to bifaces that express the greatest differences in color, while those in blue correspond to bifaces with the greatest similarities. There is a fundamental difference between the two largest groups identified in the analysis, where one corresponds with tints of gray, and the other with tints of brown. By not splitting the clusters further, raw material color group assignments allow for shifts in patination.\n\n\n\n\nBifaces were coded as ColorGroup A and ColorGroup B using the output from a neighbor-joining tree, calculated using the color distance matrix. To test whether bifaces differ in color according to ColorGroup assignment, the color distance matrix was exported and joined with the categorical data. Those data were used in a permutational multivariate analysis of variance in the vegan package to evaluate whether biface color differs by raw material color group (R Core Development Team, 2022; Oksanen et al. 2022), where the two raw material color groups were found to differ significantly (permutations = 10,000; Pr(>F) = 9.999e-05).\n\n\n\n\n\nNMDS summarizing color variation in Gahagan bifaces, where ColorGroup A is depicted in gray, and the ColorGroup B is depicted in orange with each point plotted in color space to visualize color variation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeochemistry\nA Bruker Trace Vi handheld portable X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF) instrument was used to collect elemental data. The instrument was transported to the Williamson Museum and Louisiana State Exhibit Museum and set up in a nose-down configuration, where samples were raised into contact with the pXRF window using a pair of small jacks cushioned with fabric. Due to surface irregularities, the contact between the window and the bifaces was imperfect, resulting in variable count and response rates during data collection.\nData was collected using the following scan parameters: 40kV, 35uA, Ti 25um:Al 300um filter for 180 seconds. Peaks in each spectrum were identified manually in Bruker’s Artax software; once elements were identified, the spectrum was evaluated by the Artax Bayesian statistical program to separate overlapping peaks. The Artax results were exported as net peak areas normalized to the silicon (Si) peak.\nElemental data were subsequently imported to R for a principal components analysis (PCA), followed by a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (perMANOVA), used to assess whether raw material differs between sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nComposite image illustrating the plot of first two principal components by site using a correlation matrix, illustrating 59.32 percent of cumulative shape variation, where gray squares denote Color Group A, and orange triangles denote Color Group B.\n\n\n\n\nThe PCA illustrates 59.32 percent of the variation in the sample among PC1 (42.81 percent) and PC2 (16.51 percent). The perMANOVA demonstrated that elemental values differ significantly by raw material color groups (permutations = 10,000; Pr(>F) = 0.018).\n\nRaw material color groups differ significantly in geochemistry\n\n\n\nGeometric morphometrics\nLandmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system (Bookstein et al. 1999; Gunz, Mitteroecker, and Bookstein 2005; Kendall 1981, 1984; Slice 2001), achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition (Bookstein 1986; Rohlf and Slice 1990; Rohlf 1999) in R using the geomorph and RRPP packages (Adams and Collyer 2015; Collyer and Adams 2018; Adams et al. 2017; Adams and Otarola-Castillo 2013; Baken et al. 2021). Procrustes superimposition translates and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects, while also scaling each biface using unit-centroid size—the square root of the sum of squared distances from each landmark to the specimen’s centroid (Chapman 1990; Dryden and Mardia 1998; Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990). The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Dryden and Mardia 1993; Kent and Mardia 2001; Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001).\nPrincipal components analysis (Jolliffe 2002) was used to visualize shape variation among the elliptical bifaces, and the scatterplot represents the dispersion of shapes in tangent space (Adams, Rohlf, and Slice 2013; Bookstein 1991; O’Higgins and Jones 1998; Rohlf and Marcus 1993). Shape ranges described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference image (Klingenberg 2013; Sherratt et al. 2014).\n\n\n\n\n\nPCA summarizing shape variation in Gahagan bifaces from Color Group A (gray squares) and Color Group B (orange triangles).\n\n\n\n\nTo assess whether shape and size differs by ColorGroup, Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall 1991) were run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions (Collyer, Sekora, and Adams 2015). A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs (Adams and Collyer 2015; Collyer and Adams 2018), which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present (Anderson and Ter Braak 2003).\n\nGahgan biface shape differs significantly by raw material color group\nGahagan biface size does not differ by raw material color group\nGahagan biface shape is not correlated with the geochemistry of raw material color groups\nGahagan biface size is not correlated with the geochemistry of raw material color groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean shapes summarizing variation in Gahagan bifaces from ColorGroup A and ColorGroup B. In the comparison, black spheres articulate with ColorGroupA, and gray spheres with ColorGroup B."

    "text": "Data management\nAll data and analysis code associated with this project are openly available through the GitHub repository, which is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/3JB94). Additionally, images of all Gahagan bifaces used in this study are openly available to view/download through an open access comparative collection (https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/ita-gahaganbiface/). The supplementary materials include all analysis data and code used in the study, providing a means for others to reproduce (exactly) those results discussed and expounded upon in this article. The replicable nature of this undertaking provides others with the means to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components of this study (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge.\nReproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology (Marwick 2016; Ivanovaite et al. 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020; Selden Jr. et al. 2021; Selden 2022), and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results (Marwick et al. 2019). Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have—explicitly or implicitly—a major impact on scientific progress (Peels and Bouter 2018)."
