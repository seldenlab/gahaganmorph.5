>“The question of questions for mankind—the problem which underlies all others, and is more deeply interesting than any other—is the ascertainment of the place which man occupies in nature, and of his relation to the universe of things.” **–H. Thomas Henry Huxley**, _Man’s Place in Nature_

# Basis of inquiry

Archaeologists have often made the assumption that raw material choices articulate with differences in stone tool morphology. That same logic can be extended to include the physical properties of a single raw material type---in this case, Edwards Chert---where distinct sources may similarly constrain production decisions resulting in distinct tool morphology. Gahagan bifaces from Caddo burial contexts at Mounds Plantation and Gahagan Mound are assumed to have been manufactured using Edwards Chert from central Texas sources. This is due in part to the manner in which the raw material fluoresces beneath high and low-frequency UV light, coupled with the absence of locally-available raw materials of this size and quality. Additionally, no evidence of on-site production was recovered at either site, suggesting that manufacture occurred off-site. Using the tools of 3D geometric morphometrics in tandem with pXRF, this study asks whether Gahagan biface morphology and raw materials differ by site, and whether biface morphology is correlated with raw material. Findings demonstrate that Gahagan bifaces differ in shape and raw material by site, and that biface shape is significantly correlated with raw material. At minimum, these findings suggest that the procurement of raw material used in the manufacture of Gahagan bifaces came from different locations in the Edwards Formation, and that discrete biface shapes were crafted with each. Given the absence of local production evidence at Mounds Plantation and Gahagan Mound, it is posited that the Gahagan bifaces were acquired through trade and/or exchange with central Texas groups.

## Primary findings

```{r figmap, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Location of Mounds Plantation and Gahagan Mound, local boundaries of the Red River basin (blue), and geographic extent of ancestral Caddo area (dashed white)."}

```

```{r fig02, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Gahagan bifaces from Mounds Plantation and Gahagan Mound. Bifaces k2 and p2 were not used in this analysis due to missing/damaged elements of basal morphology. Images and metadata for all Gahagan bifaces used in this study are openly available to view/download in an open access comparative collection ([https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/ita-gahaganbiface/](https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/ita-gahaganbiface/)), with permission from the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma."}

```

### Elemental data

Elemental data were imported to R for production of boxplots, principal components analysis (PCA), and a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (perMANOVA) to test whether the raw material used in the production of Gahagan bifaces differs between sites.

```{r figsite, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Composite image illustrating the plot of first two principal components by site using a correlation matrix, illustrating 66.7 percent of cumulative shape variation, where orange triangles denote Mounds Plantation, and gray squared denote Gahagan Mound."}
knitr::include_graphics('img/pcaelem-1.png')
```

Boxplots illustrated the variance and mean for each variable, and the PCA illustrates 66.7 percent of the variation in the sample among PC1 (49.65 percent) and PC2 (17.05 percent). The perMANOVA demonstrated that elemental values for raw materials used to produce Gahagan bifaces differ significantly by site (permutations = 10,000; Pr(>F) = 0.0309).

  -   Raw material used in the production of Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials _**differs significantly**_ between Mounds Plantation and Gahagan Mound
  
### Geometric morphometrics

Landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system [@RN8477;@RN7502;@RN11622;@RN11623;@RN11563], achieved through generalised Procrustes superimposition [@RN11138;@RN478;@RN1646] in R using the `geomorph` and `RRPP` packages [@RN1655;@RN11775;@RN11530;@RN1774;@RN9565]. Procrustes superimposition translates and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects, while also scaling each biface using unit-centroid size---the square root of the sum of squared distances from each landmark to the specimen’s centroid [@RN11139;@RN11140;@RN11564;@RN478]. The `geomorph` package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space [@RN11141;@RN11142;@RN1646;@RN11563].

Principal components analysis [@RN1746] was used to visualise shape variation among the elliptical bifaces, and the scatterplot represents the dispersion of shapes in tangent space [@RN8633;@RN5616;@RN11143;@RN7550]. Shape ranges described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference image [@RN1731;@RN479].

```{r figpcashape, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="PCA summarizing shape variation in Gahagan bifaces from Mounds Plantation (orange triangles) and Gahagan Mound (gray squares)."}
knitr::include_graphics('img/pcashape-1.png')
```

To assess whether `shape` and `size` differs by `site`, Procrustes ANOVAs [@RN1749] were run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions [@RN1756]. A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs [@RN1655;@RN11775], which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present [@RN1719]. An analysis of morphological disparity was used to identify potential differences in shape and size diversity between sites [@RN11107;@RN7041;@RN5694]. 

```{r fig2BPLS, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Two-block partial least-squares analysis was used to test for a correlation between Gahagan biface shape (Block 1) and elemental variables (Block 2); orange triangles, Mounds Plantation; gray squares, Gahagan Mound."}

  -   The shape of Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials at Mounds Plantation and Gahagan Mound _**differ significantly**_
  -   The size of Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials at Mounds Plantation and Gahagan Mound are consistent
  -   The analysis of morphological disparity by shape and size suggests morphological consistency between sites
  -   Gahagan biface shape is _**significantly correlated**_ with raw material
  -   Gahagan biface size is not correlated with raw material

These supplementary materials include all analysis data and code used in the study, providing a means for others to reproduce (exactly) those results discussed and expounded upon in this article. The replicable nature of this undertaking provides others with the means to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components of this study [@RN20915;@RN20916;@RN20917], which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. 

Reproducibility projects in [psychology](https://osf.io/ezcuj/) and [cancer biology](https://www.cos.io/rpcb) are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology [@RN20804;@RN21009;@RN8322;@RN8980;@RN11097], and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results [@RN21007]. Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have—explicitly or implicitly—a major impact on scientific progress [@RN21008].
