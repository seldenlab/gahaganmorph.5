>“The question of questions for mankind—the problem which underlies all others, and is more deeply interesting than any other—is the ascertainment of the place which man occupies in nature, and of his relation to the universe of things.” **–H. Thomas Henry Huxley**, _Man’s Place in Nature_

# Basis of inquiry

Nodule size and mechanical flaking properties have routinely been advanced to account for morphological differences between sites and assemblages that occur in areas where raw material is abundant. However, in instances where lithic raw materials---larger nodules in particular---were scarce, did traders from different sites interact with brokers from common extralocal communities who produced large bifaces that generally conformed to local cultural constraints? Gahagan bifaces are among those implements most diagnostic of Formative/Early Caddo material culture assemblages (CE 800 - 1250); although, due to a lack of local production evidence, it is also widely accepted that Gahagan bifaces were not produced by the Caddo. This study asks whether Caddo traders from Gahagan Mound and Mounds Plantation may have engaged in commerce with brokers from common extralocal communities to acquire Gahagan bifaces. Results demonstrate Gahagan biface geochemistry and shape to be distinct based on color group assignment. Thus, it is posited that Gahagan bifaces from Caddo mortuary contexts at Gahagan Mound and Mounds Plantation were acquired through trade with two or more non-local communities, who produced Gahagan bifaces distinct in raw material color, geochemistry, and shape.

```

### Color

Gahagan bifaces were scanned at 600 dpi using an HP ScanJet G4050. Images were subsequently transferred to a transparent background in Photoshop in preparation for analysis using the `colordistance` package in R [@R;@RN11200]. A histogram binning method was used to group similar colors, and pairwise distances between histograms were computed using earth mover’s distance, yielding two distinct raw material color groups [@RN11201;@RN11200].

```{r colorout, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Color binning process for a single object; adapted from Weller and Westneat (2019:Figure 2). In a, image of a Smithport Plain bottle with a transparent background; b, 3D scatterplot of 10,000 non-background pixels in RGB color space; c, clusters from histogram displayed in RGB color space; and d, histogram showing the proportion of non-background pixels assigned to each bin."}
knitr::include_graphics('img/fig3.png')
```

Bifaces were coded as ColorGroup A and ColorGroup B using the output from a neighbor-joining tree, calculated using the color distance matrix. To test whether bifaces differ in color according to ColorGroup assignment, the color distance matrix was exported and joined with the categorical data. Those data were used in a permutational multivariate analysis of variance in the `vegan` package to evaluate whether biface color differs by raw material color group [@R;@vegan], where the two raw material color groups were found to differ significantly (_permutations = 10,000; **Pr(>F) = 9.999e-05**_).

```{r colorspace, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Neighbor-joining tree illustrating color data for the two Gahagan biface ColorGroups; ColorGroup B (left) and ColorGroup A (right)."}

```

### Geochemistry

A Bruker Trace Vi handheld portable X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF) instrument was used to collect elemental data. The instrument was transported to the Williamson Museum and Louisiana State Exhibit Museum and set up in a nose-down configuration, where samples were raised into contact with the pXRF window using a pair of small jacks cushioned with fabric. Due to surface irregularities, the contact between the window and the bifaces was imperfect, resulting in variable count and response rates during data collection.

Data was collected using the following scan parameters: 40kV, 35uA, Ti 25um:Al 300um filter for 180 seconds. Peaks in each spectrum were identified manually in Bruker’s Artax software; once elements were identified, the spectrum was evaluated by the Artax Bayesian statistical program to separate overlapping peaks. The Artax results were exported as net peak areas normalized to the silicon (Si) peak.

Elemental data were subsequently imported to R for a principal components analysis (PCA), followed by a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (perMANOVA), used to assess whether raw material differs between sites.

```{r figsite, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Composite image illustrating the plot of first two principal components by site using a correlation matrix, illustrating 59.32 percent of cumulative shape variation, where gray squares denote Color Group A, and orange triangles denote Color Group B."}
knitr::include_graphics('img/pcaelem-1.png')
```

The PCA illustrates 59.97 percent of the variation in the sample among PC1 (42.52 percent) and PC2 (17.45 percent). The perMANOVA demonstrated that elemental values differ significantly by raw material color groups (_permutations = 10,000; **Pr(>F) = 0.0406**_).

  -   Raw material color groups **differ significantly** in geochemistry
  
### 3D geometric morphometrics

Landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system [@RN8477;@RN7502;@RN11622;@RN11623;@RN11563], achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition [@RN11138;@RN478;@RN1646] in R using the `geomorph` and `RRPP` packages [@RN1655;@RN11775;@RN11530;@RN1774;@RN9565]. Procrustes superimposition translates and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects, while also scaling each biface using unit-centroid size---the square root of the sum of squared distances from each landmark to the specimen’s centroid [@RN11139;@RN11140;@RN11564;@RN478]. The `geomorph` package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space [@RN11141;@RN11142;@RN1646;@RN11563].

Principal components analysis [@RN1746] was used to visualize shape variation among the elliptical bifaces, and the scatterplot represents the dispersion of shapes in tangent space [@RN8633;@RN5616;@RN11143;@RN7550]. Shape ranges described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference image [@RN1731;@RN479].

```{r figpcashape, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="PCA summarizing shape variation in Gahagan bifaces from Color Group A (gray squares) and Color Group B (orange triangles)."}
knitr::include_graphics('img/pcashape-1.png')
```

To assess whether `shape` and `size` differs by `ColorGroup`, Procrustes ANOVAs [@RN1749] were run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions [@RN1756]. A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs [@RN1655;@RN11775], which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present [@RN1719].

  -   Gahgan biface shape _**differs significantly**_ by raw material color group
  -   Gahagan biface size does not differ by raw material color group
  -   Gahagan biface shape is not correlated with the geochemistry of raw material color groups
  -   Gahagan biface size is not correlated with the geochemistry of raw material color groups
  
```{r figmshape, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Mean shapes summarizing variation in Gahagan bifaces from ColorGroup A and ColorGroup B. In the comparison, black spheres articulate with ColorGroupA, and gray spheres with ColorGroup B."}
