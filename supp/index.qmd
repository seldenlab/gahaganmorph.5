>“The question of questions for mankind—the problem which underlies all others, and is more deeply interesting than any other—is the ascertainment of the place which man occupies in nature, and of his relation to the universe of things.” **–H. Thomas Henry Huxley**, _Man’s Place in Nature_

# Basis of inquiry

Archaeologists regularly assume that the physical properties of lithic raw materials are a determining factor in the morphology of stone tools; although, some have argued that this assumption warrants regular testing. Raw material nodule size and mechanical flaking properties are routinely advanced to account for morphological differences that occur between sites and assemblages. Color is often used as the determining characteristic of lithic raw material, and new analytical tools allow for an objective analysis of raw material color. Two raw material color groups were identified for Gahagan bifaces from the Gahagan Mound and Mounds Plantation sites in the American Southeast. This study asks whether Gahagan biface geochemistry and morphology differs as a function of raw material color group. Findings demonstrate that Gahagan bifaces differ significantly in morphology, but not geochemistry, by raw material color group. Thus, this study yields support for the argument that lithic morphology differs between raw material color groups, while supporting the argument against the general assumption of lithic morphology as a function of raw material. Given these findings, paired with the absence of local production evidence, it is posited that Gahagan bifaces from Caddo mortuary contexts at Gahagan Mound and Mounds Plantation were acquired through trade and/or exchange with producers that operated under similar constraints, and who manufactured Gahagan bifaces to be morphologically distinct when using raw material associated with specific ranges of color.

### Color

```{r colorout, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Gahagan bifaces from Gahagan Mound and Mounds Plantation were used to identify color groups. In this graph, dark pink corresponds to bifaces that express the greatest differences in color, while those in blue correspond to bifaces with the greatest similarities. There is a fundamental difference between the two largest groups identified in the analysis, where one corresponds with tints of gray, and the other with tints of brown. By not splitting the clusters further, raw material color group assignments allow for shifts in patination."}

### Geochemistry

A Bruker Trace Vi handheld portable X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF) instrument was used to collect elemental data. The instrument was transported to the Williamson Museum and Louisiana State Exhibit Museum and set up in a nose-down configuration, where samples were raised into contact with the pXRF window using a pair of small jacks cushioned with fabric. Due to surface irregularities, the contact between the window and the bifaces was imperfect, resulting in variable count and response rates during data collection.

Data was collected using the following scan parameters: 40kV, 35uA, Ti 25um:Al 300um filter for 180 seconds. Peaks in each spectrum were identified manually in Bruker’s Artax software; once elements were identified, the spectrum was evaluated by the Artax Bayesian statistical program to separate overlapping peaks. The Artax results were exported as net peak areas normalized to the silicon (Si) peak.

Elemental data were subsequently imported to R for a principal components analysis (PCA), followed by a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (perMANOVA), used to assess whether raw material differs between sites.

```{r figsite, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Composite image illustrating the plot of first two principal components by site using a correlation matrix, illustrating 59.32 percent of cumulative shape variation, where gray squares denote Color Group A, and orange triangles denote Color Group B."}
knitr::include_graphics('img/pcaelem-1.png')
```

The PCA illustrates 59.32 percent of the variation in the sample among PC1 (42.81 percent) and PC2 (16.51 percent). The perMANOVA demonstrated that elemental values differ significantly by raw material color groups (permutations = 10,000; Pr(>F) = 0.06379).

  -   Raw material color groups do not differ in geochemistry
  
### Geometric morphometrics

Landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system [@RN8477;@RN7502;@RN11622;@RN11623;@RN11563], achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition [@RN11138;@RN478;@RN1646] in R using the `geomorph` and `RRPP` packages [@RN1655;@RN11775;@RN11530;@RN1774;@RN9565]. Procrustes superimposition translates and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects, while also scaling each biface using unit-centroid size---the square root of the sum of squared distances from each landmark to the specimen’s centroid [@RN11139;@RN11140;@RN11564;@RN478]. The `geomorph` package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space [@RN11141;@RN11142;@RN1646;@RN11563].

Principal components analysis [@RN1746] was used to visualize shape variation among the elliptical bifaces, and the scatterplot represents the dispersion of shapes in tangent space [@RN8633;@RN5616;@RN11143;@RN7550]. Shape ranges described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference image [@RN1731;@RN479].

```{r figpcashape, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="PCA summarizing shape variation in Gahagan bifaces from Color Group A (gray squares) and Color Group B (orange triangles)."}
knitr::include_graphics('img/pcashape-1.png')
```

To assess whether `shape` and `size` differs by `ColorGroup`, Procrustes ANOVAs [@RN1749] were run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions [@RN1756]. A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs [@RN1655;@RN11775], which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present [@RN1719]. An analysis of morphological disparity was used to identify potential differences in shape and size diversity between sites [@RN11107;@RN7041;@RN5694].

  -   The shape of Gahagan bifaces _**differs significantly**_ by raw material color group
  -   The size of Gahagan bifaces does not differ by raw material color group
  -   Gahagan biface shape is not correlated with the geochemistry of raw material color groups
  -   Gahagan biface size is not correlated with the geochemistry of raw material color groups

These supplementary materials include all analysis data and code used in the study, providing a means for others to reproduce (exactly) those results discussed and expounded upon in this article. The replicable nature of this undertaking provides others with the means to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components of this study [@RN20915;@RN20916;@RN20917], which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. 

Reproducibility projects in [psychology](https://osf.io/ezcuj/) and [cancer biology](https://www.cos.io/rpcb) are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology [@RN20804;@RN21009;@RN8322;@RN8980;@RN11097], and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results [@RN21007]. Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have—explicitly or implicitly—a major impact on scientific progress [@RN21008].
